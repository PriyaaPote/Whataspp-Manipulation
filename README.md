# Whataspp-Manipulation
Python project for automating  WhatsApp messaging and interaction.The provided Python script automates the process of sending messages using GUI automation and HTTP requests. It begins by prompting the user to input their name, contact number, and a message, which are then sent via an HTTP GET request to a local server running PHP scripts (msg.php and fetch.php). The script enters an infinite loop to continuously fetch messages from fetch.php, processing each response by extracting contact information and message content. Using pyautogui, it automates the GUI interaction by switching windows and simulating mouse clicks and keystrokes to send messages to retrieved contacts. Error handling is included to manage HTTP status codes, ensuring robust operation. Overall, the script combines web interaction and desktop automation to streamline the process of bulk messaging based on dynamically fetched data from a local server.
